# Voltronic Inverters Binding

This binding reads data using USB cable with the PI30 protocol from Voltronic inverters, marketed as Axpert, Effekta, Kodak, MPP Solar, No name, Voltacom and injects the information in openHAB channels.
It provides an action to send any command to the devices from openHAB.

## Communication over /dev/hidraw devices

When one end of an USB-B cable is connected in the Voltronic inverter and the other USB-A end in a Linux system, a /dev/hidraw device appears on the latter.
This binding is tested and can be configured only with such /dev/hidraw devices.
Creating a `/etc/udev/rules.d/hidraw.rules` file with content `SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0665", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5161", GROUP="dialout"` ensures that members of the dialout group, to which the openhab user belongs, have sufficient access to communicate.

For the communication to work, the nrjavaserial library needs to be patched to deal with /dev/hidraw devices, by applying the changes from https://github.com/dilyanpalauzov/nrjavaserial/commits/master/.
The release https://github.com/dilyanpalauzov/nrjavaserial/releases/tag/5.2.1-hidraw does include these changes.
To install the modified nrjavaserial-5.2.1.jar, stop openhab, clean the openHAB cache, replace the file /usr/share/openhab/runtime/system/com/neuronrobotics/nrjavaserial/5.2.1.OH1/nrjavaserial-5.2.1.OH1.jar and finally start openHAB.

## Operating mode

The thing periodically polls information from the device, using the QMOD, QPIWS and QPIGS command, and pushes data to the channel groups with the same name.  For the operation of the binding it is irrelevant whether items are bound to channels.

When the thing goes online, it sends the QID, QSID, QVFW, QMN, QVFW2, QVFW3, QPI, VERFW, QWFS, QBOOT and QGMN commands.  From their answers the thing properties are built.

If QSID returns the same serial number as QID, but after the announced length there are non-zeroes, these are added as device property “Serial Number” after a bullet.
Then the 14-digit serial number returned by QID is the text before the bullet.
![Device Properties shown under Settings -> Things](doc/properties.png)

The QPIRI and QFLAG commands, which provide data for the channel groups with the same name, are also executed when the device goes online.
Changing a setting using the device’s buttons does not transfer the new state to openHAB.
If a setting is changed over a channel in the QPIRI or QFLAG channel groups, then QPIRI and QFLAG are executed and the statuses are transferred to openHAB.
That is, after making a change using the buttons on the device, it is sufficient to toggle the backlight from openHAB to transfer the new settings to openHAB.

Sometimes on supported commands the inverter returns NAK.  When this binding receives NAK, timeout or wrong CRC, it sends the command again. If it receives NAK, timeout or wrong CRC again it sends the command one last time.

## What does not work

* Parallel mode - querying several devices using one connection
* Not tested are all other kinds of connections - RS232, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi.
In fact no openHAB thing can be created for these.
* All battery equalization stuff
* Detecting which commands the inverter supports and in turn convert some channels from read-only to read-write.
Currently the only changes via channels are made by the PD/PE, PBT00, PBT01, PBT02, PCP00, PCP01, POP00, POP01, PRG00, PRG01, PSPB0 and PSPB1 commands, as only these are supported by the inverter, owned by the author of this binding.
However, as can be seen at the end of the current file, there is an action to send arbitrary commands to the inverter.
* Discovery of devices

### Known troubles

For the serial communication to work either under Settings → Add-On Management → USB Suggestion Finder must be enabled, or an add-on from the distribution, which utilizes serial communication, must be installed.

This could be resolved by distributing `.kar` files, but openHAB does not fully utilize `.kar` files.  That said …

### Building the Binding

> mvn package -pl jar

This skips building the `kar` module and the `.kar` file.

The only known problem at runtime is that sometimes the input (PV) watts are read from the inverter, and sometimes are calculated by multiplying the input amperes with the input volts leading to different number compared to the display.  This is bug in this software.  A work-around is to unplug and plug the connecting cable.

## Policy for accepting patches

Patches, adding new channels or converting a read-only channel to write-channel by sending a command, should first detect if the feature is available by the connected inverter, and not offer it for all inverters.

## Supported Things

`inverter`: This binding supports one thing type: Voltronic inverter.

## Thing Configuration

| Name            | Type    | Description                                 | Default | Required |
|-----------------|---------|---------------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| port            | text    | Where the connecting cable is plugged       | N/A     | yes      |
| refreshInterval | integer | Interval the device is polled in millisec.  | 750     | no       |

Example configuration file

```
Thing voltronic:inverter:f [port="/dev/hidraw0", refreshInterval="2000"]
```

## Channels

The provided channels are grouped, based on the command which provides data for the channel - QMOD, QPIGS, QPIWS, QFLAG, and QPIRI.

### Autoupdate is disabled

The current binding has disabled generating a predicted state, when a command changing a setting (PE, PD, PBT, PCP, POP, PRG and PSPB) is sent to the inverter over a channel.
After sending the command, the binding queues the current state with the QFLAG and QPIRI commands and updates the channels with the new state.
If the inverter rejects (ignores, vetoes) the command, the initial state of the item does not change.
[BasicUI](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-webui/issues/3456) in such case shows the state, which the user modified to, not the state, returned by the inverter.
Having `autoupdate="true"` below is necessary when using BasicUI with sitemaps, so that the item changes to the new state and then returns to the old one, when the inverter might reject the command.
Enabling Power Saving (PEj) is an example for a command, which inverters may ignore.

### The Channels

The descriptions can be read in the documentation from Voltronic for the respective command.
Channels are listed in the order the reply returns data.
The third column (T) contains R for Read-only channels or W for Read-Write channels.
Read-only means that the value may or may not be modifiable on the device or by the `voltronicSend()` action.

## Full Example

### Thing Configuration

```java
Thing voltronic:inverter:f [port="/dev/hidraw0"]
```

### Item Configuration

#### Tags in .items file definitions

Since openHAB 5.1 when services/runtime.cfg:org.openhab.ItemChannelLinkRegistry:useTags=true is set, tags are inherited from the binding and the text between [], when not applied to a Group (first two lines below), can be skipped.  Since openHAB 5.1 the quotes around Switch can be skipped.

The tags Calculation, Mode and Info are recognized since openHAB 5.0.
Use Calculation instead of Measurement for qpigs#inputPower, when the display does not show and the device does not transmit the power from PV.
In this case inputPower is calculated as the product of qpigs#inputCurrent and qpigs#sccVoltage.

## Actions

The `voltronicSend()` action sends a command to the inverter and returns the answer.  It returns `null` if there is a timeout (disconnected cable); or empty string, if the device answers but the CRC does not match.  Otherwise it delivers what the inverter answered.

```
val voltronicActions = getActions("voltronic", "voltronic:inverter:f") // second parameter must be thing name
logError("vi",  voltronicActions.voltronicSend("QPIRI"))
```

Sending a command, not supported by the inverter, might lead to the inverter not responding, which is the same as timeout.  Timeout means that the inverter is disconnected and will go offline.  When the next polling command works, the inverter will go back online.
